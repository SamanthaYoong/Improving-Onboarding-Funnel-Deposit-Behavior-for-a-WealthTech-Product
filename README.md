#  Case Study: Improving Onboarding Funnel & Deposit Behavior for a WealthTech Product

## 📈 Objective
Simulate the role of a **Product Data Analyst** at **StashAway** by:

- Monitoring a product feature launch (a redesigned onboarding flow).
- Analyzing funnel performance and deposit behaviors post-launch.
- Delivering data-driven recommendations for user growth and product optimization.

---

## 📈 Approach

### 1️⃣ Product Launch Monitoring
- Defined **key success metrics** for the new onboarding flow (`Signup → KYC → Portfolio Setup → First Deposit`).
- Created **Tableau dashboards** tracking real-time KPIs (conversion rates, time-to-complete KYC, drop-off points).
- Collaborated with a simulated “PM team” to **pre-set event tracking** (`kyc_start`, `portfolio_created`, `deposit_initiated`) for clean data flow.

### 2️⃣ Funnel & Drop-off Analysis
- Analyzed **50K users** through the funnel:
  - **Step 1:** Signup → KYC start **(87%)**
  - **Step 2:** KYC → Portfolio Setup **(65%)**
  - **Step 3:** Portfolio Setup → First Deposit **(48%)**
- Identified **KYC verification delays** and **funding friction** as major drop-off drivers.

### 3️⃣ Deposit Behavior Insights
- Segmented users by **deposit method** (bank transfer, credit card, FPX).
- Found **FPX users** converted **2× faster** and deposited **20% more** on average.
- Discovered **weekend signups** had a **15% lower first-deposit rate** — likely due to verification/support gaps.

### 4️⃣ Post-Launch Reporting & Next Steps
- Built a **Launch Impact Dashboard** ([Tableau Public – placeholder link]) summarizing:
  - Conversion uplift after onboarding redesign (+12% overall)
  - 30-day cohort retention
  - Deposit frequency & average value by channel
- Recommended **3 strategic actions**:
  1. **Streamline KYC** with weekend support → **+8% funnel improvement**
  2. **Prioritize FPX** in UI → **+20% lift in first deposits**
  3. **Run A/B test** on onboarding email nudges → improve **time-to-deposit**

## 📈 Key Deliverables
- ✅ **Tableau Dashboards**: Funnel tracking, deposit behavior segmentation, post-launch performance.
- ✅ **SQL Queries**: Joined onboarding events with deposit logs for analysis.
- ✅ **Insights Report (5 pages)**: Highlighted findings for the Product & Growth team.
- ✅ **Recommendations Presentation**: Actionable next steps with forecasted impact.

## 📈 Impact (Hypothetical Scenario)
- **First-deposit conversion:** +15% within 3 weeks  
- **Deposit volume:** +20% from FPX channel focus  
- **Onboarding completion:** 10% drop-off reduction at KYC stage
